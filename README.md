## What I found most difficult

1. I found it very difficult to revert my web design back to its original form after I put the Bootstrap link in my HTML file. For instance, my responsive design was much more neater regarding how the buttons stacked on top of each other once the width of the screen was reduced. Also the size of my div container was much bigger before bootstrap.

2. I tried to uncheck the boxes on the developer tool on google chrome to return my website to its original. Whilst I was able to make some changes, I was unable to make them all. As I result, I had to settle for a design I did not want. On the plus side, bootstrap enabled me to have buttons in my nav bar.

## What I am most pleased with

1. I am pleased about the huge amount of skills I have learnt within my first week.
