        <h2 class="about">About me</h2>
        <p class="about">
          I am a strong problem solver, using my logical approach to arrive at conclusions.  During my experience as a data validator, I developed an interest in software when I noticed the flaws of the various software systems used to deliver healthcare services. I looked at ways in which they could be developed and improved and started to learn Java in my spare time. I learnt about object oriented development, web programming, JDBC as well as how to use IDEs such as Eclipse. My interest in technology and its impact on the effective delivery of services led me to want to pursue a career in software development.

        <p class="about">
          My strengths is my adaptability, for example as a NHS data validator at various hospitals I had to learn how to use many different software systems to aid in the delivery of healthcare services. I also had to adapt to a variety of working environments. This experience also developed my problem solving skills by applying NHS referral to treatment rules to patient pathway situations in order to determine the correct codes to enter into hospitals’ database systems. I am a very good communicator and this is something that was developed during my degree as I participated in mooting competitions and during my time as a street fundraiser for the British Red Cross.  As naturally enthusiastic and disciplined  person, I am always pushing himself to learn new things, for example I undertook Physics GCSE on my own and achieved an A*.
